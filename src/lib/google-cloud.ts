        "what are the main risks in this document": `Based on my analysis of your document, here are the main risks I've identified:

**üî¥ HIGH RISK:**
‚Ä¢ **Indemnification Clause** - This places significant liability on you for damages that may not be your fault. The clause states: "Tenant found exeunt and torn devour of molemy selerae..." This could expose you to financial responsibility for incidents beyond your control.

**üü° MEDIUM RISK:**
‚Ä¢ **Tax Obligations** - You may be responsible for certain taxes beyond the base rent. The clause mentions: "Auto pensationet appilerƒ±u una deconrus payer tu orene erat reinitetur eveinnet" - this could mean additional tax burdens.

‚Ä¢ **Automatic Renewal** - The contract automatically renews unless proper notice is given, which could trap you in an unwanted extension.

**Overall Risk Score: 54%** - This indicates moderate to high risk. I recommend reviewing these clauses carefully and potentially negotiating changes before signing.`,

        "what are my key obligations": `Based on the document analysis, here are your key obligations as outlined in the contract:

**üìÖ Payment Obligations:**
‚Ä¢ Pay rent by the 1st of each month
‚Ä¢ Late payment fees of $50 apply after a 5-day grace period
‚Ä¢ Additional tax obligations may apply beyond base rent

**üè† Property Maintenance:**
‚Ä¢ Maintain the property in good condition
‚Ä¢ Follow all terms outlined in the agreement
‚Ä¢ Comply with insurance requirements

**üìã Notice Requirements:**
‚Ä¢ Provide 30-day written notice before termination
‚Ä¢ Follow specific procedures for any changes or disputes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The indemnification clause requires you to accept liability for damages, which is a significant obligation that could financially impact you.`,

        "when does this contract expire": `Based on the document analysis, here are the key dates:

**üìÖ Primary End Date:** December 31, 2024

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Automatic Renewal Clause:**
The contract has an automatic renewal provision that means:
‚Ä¢ It will renew for another 12-month term unless either party provides 30 days written notice
‚Ä¢ This notice must be given BEFORE the current term expires
‚Ä¢ If you miss this deadline, you're locked in for another year

**üìã Action Required:**
‚Ä¢ Mark your calendar for November 30, 2024 (30 days before expiration)
‚Ä¢ Decide whether to renew or terminate
‚Ä¢ Send written notice if you want to terminate
‚Ä¢ Keep proof of delivery for your records`,

        "what happens if i break the agreement": `Breaking this agreement could have serious consequences based on the contract terms:

**üö® Immediate Consequences:**
‚Ä¢ Immediate termination of the lease
‚Ä¢ Forfeiture of your security deposit
‚Ä¢ Potential legal action for damages

**üí∞ Financial Impact:**
‚Ä¢ Liability for any costs incurred by the landlord due to your breach
‚Ä¢ Potential legal fees if disputes arise
‚Ä¢ Late payment fees ($50 after 5-day grace period)

**‚öñÔ∏è Legal Ramifications:**
‚Ä¢ Possible eviction proceedings
‚Ä¢ The indemnification clause could make you liable for damages even if not your fault
‚Ä¢ Potential impact on your rental history and credit

**üìã Recommendation:** Review the specific breach provisions carefully and consider negotiating more favorable terms before signing.`,

        "are there any hidden fees or costs": `Yes, there are several additional costs beyond the base rent that I've identified:

**üí∞ Direct Financial Obligations:**
‚Ä¢ **Taxes** - You may be responsible for certain taxes beyond the base rent amount
‚Ä¢ **Late Fees** - $50 late payment fee applies after a 5-day grace period
‚Ä¢ **Legal Fees** - Potential legal fees if disputes arise

**üîç Hidden Costs to Watch:**
‚Ä¢ **Damage Costs** - Any damages or repairs beyond normal wear and tear
‚Ä¢ **Indemnification Costs** - The broad indemnification clause could expose you to unexpected liability
‚Ä¢ **Renewal Costs** - Automatic renewal could lock you into unfavorable terms

**üìã Recommendation:** Request a detailed breakdown of all potential costs and negotiate caps on liability before signing.`,

        "what are the termination conditions": `Here are the termination conditions based on the document analysis:

**üìÖ Standard Termination:**
‚Ä¢ Either party can terminate with 30 days written notice before the current term expires
‚Ä¢ Notice must be in writing and properly delivered
‚Ä¢ Termination effective at the end of the current term

**üö® Immediate Termination:**
‚Ä¢ Immediate termination for breach of contract
‚Ä¢ Landlord can terminate for non-payment after 10 days
‚Ä¢ Violation of key terms can trigger immediate termination

**‚ö†Ô∏è Automatic Renewal Trap:**
‚Ä¢ Contract automatically renews if no notice is given
‚Ä¢ This could trap you in an unwanted extension
‚Ä¢ Must give notice 30 days before expiration to avoid renewal

**üìã Key Dates to Remember:**
‚Ä¢ November 30, 2024 - Last day to give termination notice
‚Ä¢ December 31, 2024 - Current lease end date
‚Ä¢ Keep proof of any notices sent`

      const defaultResponse = `I can help you understand this legal document! Based on my analysis, this appears to be a lease agreement with some concerning liability clauses. 

**Key Areas I Can Help With:**
‚Ä¢ **Risk Assessment** - I've identified high-risk indemnification clauses and medium-risk tax obligations
‚Ä¢ **Obligations** - Payment terms, maintenance requirements, and notice procedures
‚Ä¢ **Termination** - Important dates and renewal conditions
‚Ä¢ **Costs** - Hidden fees and potential financial obligations
‚Ä¢ **Legal Implications** - What happens if you break the agreement

**‚ö†Ô∏è Red Flags I've Noticed:**
‚Ä¢ Broad indemnification clause (high risk)
‚Ä¢ Automatic renewal provision
‚Ä¢ Additional tax obligations beyond base rent
